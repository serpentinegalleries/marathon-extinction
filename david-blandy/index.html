title: Tutorial: How to make a short video about extinction

bio: David Blandy investigates the different modes of contemporary commercial and amateur moving image, from the documentary confessional and music video to television series, anime and the narrative sections of computer games. Within each work, he deconstructs the form, taking the role of alienated subject in a prefabricated cultural archetype. Blandy questions our relationship with the narratives that shape us, searching for the meaning of identity in todayâ€™s globalised culture.
