        <p>This work of net.art is a corporate and institutional cross-projection and a brutal manifestation of Newspeak. The destruction of common meaning in language drives extinction and creates collateral damage when Data Mining industries talk and act on ‘Real-Time Anti-Fraud’ and ‘Counter-Terrorism Financing’. Real meaning disappears behind profit-seeking and every transaction is under suspicion. The never-ending tracking of people’s actions is (mis)labeled as customer service.</p>

        <p>The video shows a tracking shot of aerial images of BP’s &#39;Deepwater Horizon’ oil-spill in the Gulf of Mexico, beautifully wrapped around a sphere. The source images are from the massive oil-painting on an 80.000 square-mile canvas with over 800 million liters of oil. This piece cements the position of oil-painting as the supreme discipline of art, but at the same time gives evidence of the delicate and endangered position of painting if the discipline refuses to radically embrace technology.</p>
