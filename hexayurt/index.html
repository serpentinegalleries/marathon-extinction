The Hexayurt building&#39;s design is in the Buckminster Fuller lineage of using contiguous triangles to maximize the load-bearing ability of simple structures. For constructions made from light material the panels can be joined by tape. For heavier builds made out of OSB or plywood, metal brackets or wooden blocks can be used. The instructions are available on <a href="http://appropedia.org">Appropedia</a> (Appropedia is used as the wiki for the hexayurt project) and are released as public domain by the inventor Vinay Gupta.</p>
