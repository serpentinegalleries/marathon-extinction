<p>BioLudditism poses a challenge to the commonly accepted effects of bio-technologies, taking as its starting point the complex debate surrounding monocultures: GMOs, systems ecology, pandemic prevention, food deserts, sugar addiction, hormone replacement, public healthcare and the long arm of the biotech industry.</p>
<p>Following on from the NearNow panel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akfwKBdEAQc" target="_blank">‘Where are the Luddites: An Open Call for Bioluddites’</a> earlier this year, and the writing up of the Bioluddite Charter at the Breaking the Frame conference, Lisa Ma will use the next few months to continue her research into the contemporary resurgence of Ludditism.</p>
<p>Commencing with a series of interviews and sound recordings with participants other at this year’s <em>Extinction Marathon: Vision of the Future</em>, these will be released online over the course of the weekend.</p>

<h3 id="bioluddite">BioLuddite</h3>
<p>Could Luddites curate wiser technologies in The Biotech Revolution? In the 1800s a community of revolutionaries called Luddites protested against the social changes imposed upon the way people live by the introduction of factory machinery. Armed with a fake king and instruction manuals of machine destruction through songs, the legend of the Luddites became a derogatory term of anyone that opposes technological progress.  </p>
<p>In an age of makers and open source communities of The Digital Revolution, Bioluddites is a brave new step in socializing our relationship with biotechnology as well as the role of activism in the innovation process. The widespread phenomenon of DIY tinkering and open source communities has brought notions of citizenship closer to technology by making communities retrofit digital components on the market to their own needs. But in the new technology revolution, the needs of the everyday people should be considered before commercialization for the needs of corporations. </p>
<p>Bioluddites is a series of ongoing research and real-life experiments inspired by the Luddite community to create scenarios that make people think deeply and socially about how the next technological revolution will affect the way we live and make our living.</p>
<p>In collaboration with The Serpentine Gallery, I had the opportunity to ask some thought-leaders to help me ponder about what they think of the subject:</p>
<p><strong>James Bridle</strong> is a writer, artist and publisher literature, culture and technology. He questions and evaluates the application of technology and its methods of production and release. Bridle is the author of the <strong>New Aesthetic</strong> project that spurred much debate and gives lectures about the invisibility of technology.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“As soon as you introduce the word technology into a general conversation, people will have a fairly polarized result to it. That’s because you’re starting to talk about very complex, difficult things and complex difficult things have always been in the domain of experts. Most people are simply not confident enough to engage in those conversations because it is always framed as a domain for experts.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bridle argues that we can’t know how to evaluate risk in biotech without a social process. He believes that Luddites are essential to technology on the basis that Luddism was a social movement and technology is always formed by social processes. Bridle works to make the general public understand complexities, making a parallel between our general over simplification of technological systems with our inability to logically evaluate risk.</p>

<p><strong>Martin John Reas</strong>, the Astronomer Royal, writes books on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy" target="_blank">astronomy</a> and the problems relating to science, ethics and politics. Reas is the cofounder of The Centre for the Study of Existential Risk (CSER), a research centre at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Cambridge" target="_blank">University of Cambridge</a>, that studies “extinctional risk” posed by present or future technology.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It’s certainly true that people are rather irrational in the way that we calibrate risks. We fret too much about minor things, like carcinogens in food, low radiation doses, train crashes and things like that. We&#39;re in denial about some much bigger risks and I would include bio-error and bio-terror amongst those.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reas emphasizes that there is a risk in releasing biotechnologies out of labs that is even less controlled than in lab situations. We spoke about the pandemic of panic in cases of disasters such as the Ebola virus and when more attention should have been placed for longer-term investment in countries with little infrastructure.</p>

<p><strong>Carolyn Christov-Bakargiev</strong> was was the Artistic Director of Documenta 2013, an exhibition of modern and contemporary art that takes place for 100 days in Kessel, Germany, every five years. Named in 2012 as number one in the Power 100 list of the most influential figures in contemporary art, Christov-Bakargiev is the curator of of Istanbul Biennial. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Techne means craft… The question is not a question of today. The point is how they are used.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Christov Christov-Bakargiev</strong> ponders with us about the meaning of technology and gives examples of how technology is a natural course. She believes that technology itself is not a problem and that there is no distinction between the organic and inorganic. However, she emphasizes what she calls the misuse of and bad “ideas” in applying technology, such as using corn for fuel rather than food in biofuel, or in caring for the elderly with technology rather than humans. </p>

<h3 id="innovation-of-revolutions">Innovation of Revolutions</h3>
<p>If innovation is the end goal of new technologies, is all innovation really beneficial or simply reinforcing an over-optimism in newness? How might there be less wasteful and more constructive playgrounds for innovation in the kickstarter culture? Even the word ‘revolution’ is now a word reserved for large, anticipated technological breakthroughs rather than its original term for a shift in social order. In fact, revolts are viewed as negative obstacles against progress, exemplified by The Luddites. </p>
<p>Cultural Theorist Byung-Chul Han warns about today’s “terror of positivity”. In a society that discourages any opposition, even systems originally for the benefit of social uses will become quietly twisted for the control of customers. Negativity is associated with laziness, a lack of imagination and unproductivity.</p>
<p>However, Luddism generated opposition using a creative process. The Luddites understood the social conditions of activism in Nottingham and had expertise in creating mythical activist figures. The folklore of Robin Hood was used as early as the 13th Century to name outlaws. The name ‘Robin’ was a common stock name and ‘Hood’ meant anyone wearing a hat or a hood to hide their identities. The name that was itself the nature of safe resistance would later inspire modern movements such as Anonymous.</p>
<p>The Luddites went a step further, by making a fake king. They understood that social movements in a time of military power, people fought for popes and kings. The Luddites’ movement needed a central figure. Yet their experience taught them that leaders of revolutions were often killed, so they created a fake king. The character of Ned Ludd, often known as Captain Ludd, General Ludd or King Ludd that would be used to sign protest letters and head wars.</p>
<p><em>“Negativity slows down and prevents a chain reaction of sameness” - Byung-Chul Han.</em></p>
<p>The history of revolution of protest has shaped our society. Revolutions save human history from becoming a linear trajectory of what technology wants. In each era, Agricultural, Industrial, Digital, communities have revolted against the way that resources are distributed. There’s a world of innovation in the field of activism that we are wasting away:</p>
<p><em>Tattoo head: The Revolt of Ionia (in present-day Turkey) BC499</em><br>In order to send an undetected message to for the trapped General Histiaeus, his favorite servant tattooed the word “revolt” on his shaven head and waited for it to grow back before travelling to deliver the disguised message.</p>

<p><em>Bite the Bullet: The Indian Rebellion, 1857</em><br>Debate about the inequality of treatment to Indian soldiers was started by rumours that the paper cartridges, which had to bitten to open before being ignited, were greased with cow fat. </p>

<p><em>Invention of the Zoo: During The French Revolution, 1793</em><br>The National Assembly decreed that all aristocrats’ exotic animals were to be either killed and stuffed for scientific purposes or donated to the Jardin des Plantes. The latter became the zoo. </p>

<p><em>Fem Warrior: Vietnam, BC248</em><br>Lady Triệu initiated a culture of resistance against the Chinese Empire and confronted every aspect of the eastern Confucian &#39;womanhood&#39;, winning battle her gender confused the Chinese soldiers. Over time Lady Triệu gained superhuman status in a mythical feminism: “breasts three feet long, which she reportedly threw over her shoulders as she rode her elephant into battle”.</p>

<h3 id="bios-voices-of-labourers">Bios Voices of Labourers</h3>
<p>&#39;The Biotech Revolution&#39; is hailed as the new technological era but has in fact been an integral part of our everyday lives for a long while, controlled by large industries. It is already a fundamental aspect of everyday life and the political system in which we operate in, yet is still presented as a far, distant future.</p>
<p>In an age of tinkering and open source communities of The Digital Revolution, decentralized citizen lab-based for synbio has mushroomed as centers to familiarize people on <em>what</em> biotechnology actually is, but are we asking enough questions about the <em>how</em> it will be used?</p>
<p>As <strong>Carolyn Christov-Bakargiev</strong> pointed out again:</p>
<p>Bios = the manner of living (<em>the how</em>)<br>Zio = alive, living (<em>the what</em>)</p>
<p>(audio Carolyn_01 0:34-3:30 &amp; Carolyn_02)</p>
<p>Rather than asking about for or against biotechnology per say, we as citizens, should take a closer and more active stance in the how biotechnology will be used, integrated and eventually, socialized. With such an “compromised term” of Bioluddite, Biotechnology and Bio-era, we should be taking a closer step in its political system of integration rather than passively allow decisions to be made for commercialization alone. </p>
<h3 id="how-will-biotechnology-change-our-work-conditions-our-healthcare-plans-our-pension-schemes-our-livelihood-">How will biotechnology change our work conditions, our healthcare plans, our pension schemes, our livelihood?</h3>
<p>BioLuddite transfers the traditional voice of a social critique towards this new technology revolution, to ensure thatprogress is anchored towards what people want, rather than what technology wants. This would be a technological revolution. Let’s socialize before we commercialise.</p>
