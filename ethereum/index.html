<p>Ether, Ethereum&#39;s cryptofuel, powers the applications on a decentralized network. Ethereum can be used to codify, decentralize, secure and trade just about anything, from intellectual property to smart property.</p>
<p>Ethereum makes use of one of the lesser known innovations by Satashi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous person or group of people who designed and created the original Bitcoin software. When Nakamoto set the Bitcoin blockchain into motion in 2009, two radical and untested concepts were introduced. Bitcoin as a currency unit has taken up the bulk of public attention. However, there is also another, equally important, part to Satoshi&#39;s grand experiment: the concept of a proof of work-based blockchain to allow for public agreement on the order of transactions. Attention is starting to shift toward this second part of Bitcoin&#39;s technology, and how the blockchain concept can be used for more than just money.</p>
<p>What Ethereum intends to provide is a blockchain with a built-in fully fledged Turing-complete programming language that can be used to create &quot;contracts&quot; for encoding arbitrary state transition functions. Simply by writing up the logic in a few lines of code, users will be allowed to create systems such as domain names, decentralized exchange, financial derivatives and on-blockchain identity and reputation systems. Another important area of inquiry is &quot;smart contracts&quot; - systems which automatically move digital assets according to pre-specified rules. The logical extension of this is decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) - long-term smart contracts that contain the assets and the bylaws of an entire organization.</p>
