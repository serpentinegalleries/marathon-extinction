							<p class="text-center">A Modern Research Drama by Anna Zett<br>
    Germany/USA 2014
</p>

<p>Dinosaurs linger behind the horizon of colonial capitalism, waiting to be appropriated for profit or mythology. Against the backdrop of an unresolved disruption called the End of History, the artist as scientist as protagonist performs an inquiry into the contradictions of progress. Dig sites become crime scenes and fossils turn into characters, determined to play a main part in the fantastic history of the US-American West.</p>

							<p>A blood rite/ mourning ritual/gift ceremony for tomorrow &#38; tomorrow. JD uses a pencil and a needle in a distributed ink drawing practice that takes place between bodies in a space of mutual exchange. The custodian of each drawing makes the first sketch in words as part of a conversation process where narratives are shared and compared, and where the groundwork is laid in language for making a meaningful ritual. Finally, the image is etched in ink on the body, where it will stay - on the cellular level at least - until the death of that body and beyond. The practice is a way of manifesting networked kinship in precarious times; it is also an attempt to contain the accumulated trauma of a life through externalising scar tissue as a badge of what we have already survived. Above all it is a &#39;despite-everything&#39; gesture of defiance to death (of physical bodies, community and communities), commoditisation, pointless posterity, monolithic art praxes that echo the totality of state sovereignty, and a way to embrace the inevitable, together.</p>

							Jesse Darling is an artist living in London. Their work addresses the human condition and how it is mediated through the structures, narratives and technologies that govern life as we know it, considering the social and physical body as a site where they manifest and become transformed. JD works in sculpture, installation, text and ‘dasein by design’ – where performance and unmediated experience meet. Exhibitions include Private Settings: Art After the Internet (Museum of Modern Art, Warsaw), Preteen Gallery’s It’s been four years since 2010 and Not Long Now at LIMAZULU, London, 2014. JD is represented by Arcadia_Missa.

							<p>The Ongoing Collapse is a growing collection of data sources and links positioned as a reflection of the state of the world in the terms that it likes to use. It&#39;s a gentle ticking of the crumbling weird at the base of civilisation, quoting e.g. the present value of crude oil, the number of parts per million of carbon in the atmosphere or the number of man-made objects in space. The Ongoing Collapse forms a central platform of The Serpentine&#39;s <strong><em>EXTINCT.LY</em></strong>.</p>

							David Blandy investigates the different modes of contemporary commercial and amateur moving image, from the documentary confessional and music video to television series, anime and the narrative sections of computer games. Within each work, he deconstructs the form, taking the role of alienated subject in a prefabricated cultural archetype. Blandy questions our relationship with the narratives that shape us, searching for the meaning of identity in today’s globalised culture.

							<p>A blood rite/ mourning ritual/gift ceremony for tomorrow &#38; tomorrow. JD uses a pencil and a needle in a distributed ink drawing practice that takes place between bodies in a space of mutual exchange. The custodian of each drawing makes the first sketch in words as part of a conversation process where narratives are shared and compared, and where the groundwork is laid in language for making a meaningful ritual. Finally, the image is etched in ink on the body, where it will stay - on the cellular level at least - until the death of that body and beyond. The practice is a way of manifesting networked kinship in precarious times; it is also an attempt to contain the accumulated trauma of a life through externalising scar tissue as a badge of what we have already survived. Above all it is a &#39;despite-everything&#39; gesture of defiance to death (of physical bodies, community and communities), commoditisation, pointless posterity, monolithic art praxes that echo the totality of state sovereignty, and a way to embrace the inevitable, together.</p>

							<p>The Ongoing Collapse is a growing collection of data sources and links positioned as a reflection of the state of the world in the terms that it likes to use. It&#39;s a gentle ticking of the crumbling weird at the base of civilisation, quoting e.g. the present value of crude oil, the number of parts per million of carbon in the atmosphere or the number of man-made objects in space. The Ongoing Collapse forms a central platform of The Serpentine&#39;s <strong><em>EXTINCT.LY</em></strong>.</p>

<p>Global warming, natural disasters and extinction aren&#39;t bad news for everyone. They open up new frontiers for financial markets in terms of investment but also on a infrastructural level. Financial markets can quantify and price everything. The melting Arctic ice uncovers new lines for trading algorithms, future hurricanes are compressed into CAT bonds, endangered species are vaporised into speculative financial products. For traders it is not relevant if and why places become colder, dryer, wetter or stormier, it is the rising weather volatility that counts. Rising weather volatility generates an increasing number of events which means more opportunities to speculate. Catastrophe is a safe bet.</p>
<p><img src="/images/participants/Volatility-Storms_1.gif" alt="Artic Cables"></p>
<h2 id="artic-cables">Artic Cables</h2>
<h4 id="1-location-artic-ocean">1. LOCATION: ARTIC OCEAN</h4>
<p>The future Arctic is described as the discovery of a new continent with untapped resources, exotic ecosystems and new trade lanes. Global warming will literally open up faster routes for trading algorithms in the Arctic. The melting ice will make it possible to lay submarine cables onto the Arctic sea floor. These Arctic submarine cables will be solely constructed for increasing speed. In the near future should shortcut the data connection between the financial markets of London and Tokyo that are now linked via the Middle-East and Pacific. Latency is expected to drop substantially, data traffic is expected to be 30% faster. Less ice means more – and faster – money.</p>
<p><img src="/images/participants/Volatility-Storms_2.gif" alt="Artic Land"></p>
<h2 id="arctic-land">Arctic Land</h2>
<h4 id="2-location-greenland">2. LOCATION: GREENLAND</h4>
<p>“The best investment opportunities in the last 12,000 years,” is how investors are describing the Arctic region. For financial markets the Arctic is the Next Big Thing: a new frontier of imagination and investment opportunities. Melting ice will make massive gas and oil fields in the Arctic sea more accessible, will make the now frozen tundras suitable for agriculture and valuable minerals of which the Arctic is rich – such as sink, iron, gold and nickel – more easy to mine. Investing in the Arctic brings along massive financial and ecological risks, but financial markets thrive on risks. Currently investors are trying to get a foothold by making Arctic land deals and planning new infrastructures. Participating in the Arctic chess game will make a lot of people rich.</p>
<p><img src="/images/participants/Volatility-Storms_3.gif" alt="Catastrophe Bonds"></p>
<h2 id="catastrophe-bonds">Catastrophe Bonds</h2>
<h4 id="3-location-hawaii">3. LOCATION: HAWAII</h4>
<p>On October 18th 2014 Hurricane Ana is expected to hit Hawaii. When it does is can create big profits and losses in the financial markets. Catastrophe bonds turn floods, volcanic eruptions, hurricanes, earthquakes, tsunamis into financial products. Financial risks from natural disasters are highly concentrated in a few places. With a rising weather volatility and number of natural disasters, insurers and governments increasingly have problems covering big catastrophic risks. Instead they sell catastrophe bonds to spread the risk. The buyer of this bond invest his money in a catastrophe insurance and loses it all when a specified natural disaster happens within a predetermined number of years. This way the seller ensure himself against extreme losses and pays the buyer a high interest rate. Spreading risks in broader markets via cat-bonds is like distributing an earthquake of the highest level across the planet so no one will feel it. Cat-bonds deal with rare events and there’s a great uncertainty involved, yet when a natural disaster hits it hits hard. These moments of disruption are perfect for investors: taking very high risks can return a lot of profits when the coin fall on the right side.</p>
<p><img src="/images/participants/Volatility-Storms_4.gif" alt="Species Swap"></p>
<h2 id="species-swap">Species Swap</h2>
<h4 id="4-location-mediterranean-sea">4. LOCATION: MEDITERRANEAN SEA</h4>
<p>It can be profitable for speculators to contribute to the depletion of animal stocks thereby speeding up the extinction process: e.g. Atlantic blue tuna fish are frozen in anticipation of future prices. When going extinct stockpiles of a specie (or its body parts) become of infinite value. New anticipated financial products – the so called “species swap” – are derivatives that should preserve endangered species. Fiscal and debt crisis withhold states back from investing in biodiversity and gives way to the financialisation of animals. Species swap contracts secures the efforts of investors to look after a specific habitat of an endangered species. If the species goes up in number the state pays the investor interest, if the number declines the state receives money from the investor. Species as renewable or non-renewable resources, betting on extinction or survival works either way.</p>
<p><img src="/images/participants/Volatility-Storms_5.gif" alt="Water futures contracts"></p>
<h2 id="water-futures-contracts">Water futures contracts</h2>
<h4 id="5-location-sudan">5. LOCATION: SUDAN</h4>
<p>The oil of the 21st century is too cheap and undervalued, and governments have only started to realise this by criminalising the harvesting of grey water. Collecting rainwater is, for example, illegal in the US and will put you in jail. Investing in water companies and infrastructure helps securing its value in the future, just as making land and water deals in undeveloped areas of the world. Yet, trading water as a commodity opens a new perspective for international financial markets. Usable water will become scarce and will need to mined, processed and stored. Local shortages and surpluses around the world and the highly political prices that differ per country creates a need for water to be moved around the world. This generates a competitive landscape for a international water futures market. When water is disconnected from its local territory and its ownership can be traded in exchanges, then water truly becomes liquid, global and directly convertible to cash.</p>

							<h3 id="reversing-the-flow-of-internet-expansion">Reversing the Flow of Internet Expansion</h3>
<p>Why would you want to contract when you can expand? Internet activity is supposed to be a positive act of self-expansion. We fill up the internet with our lives. Growth has defined the internet up until the present moment. It is a conquest that seeks more users, more followers, more hits, increases in speed, increases in storage space, and the acquisition of new and better methods to manage and sustain an ever-expanding quantity of data. Keeping pace with this growth has become required participation for a normal person living according to the customs of our time. A sort of millennial manifest destiny, the growth of the internet is widely considered good evolution for humanity. But if the internet is expanding, something else must be contracting because of that expansion.</p>
<p>The tricky thing about expansion is that it comes with a lot of heat. Few environmentalists are willing to accept my revolutionary new theory: the warming of the internet is another sign of climate change :) Fast and ruthless growth results in uncomfortably hot psychic environments. Excessive sharing between inefficient devices fills the atmosphere with toxic gasses. Friction between competing technologies further heats up exchanges. By heat I mean speed and pressure. People love warm weather - more of us live in hot climates than freezing ones, and good luck trying to convince your friend who loves hot weather to move to a cold city. Fully radiant at all times, blinding yet distant as an alien star, the internet can be a harsh place to live.</p>
<p>One reason the internet is so hard to relate to is because it does not contract itself. Human biomass goes through phases of growth, but the body is self-softening. Cells weaken and shrink in number, contracting towards death. When Gmail first came out Google promised such vast space available on their internet that old emails no longer needed to be deleted. Users could just chuck more data on top of the pile, stacking the tower ever higher. Other websites followed suit, encouraging users to avoid letting go by archiving instead. This would be like a human body growing new cells without any old cells dying. Such growth cannot be sustained. It is an example of expansion run wild. Since the internet is about growth, the culture of the internet does not value loss. This is why I feel there is such a strong sense of diffusion on the internet today and so little cohesion. Cohesion comes about through contraction, not expansion.</p>
<p>Expansion is warming while contraction is cooling. Cooling is difficult to come by in the current technological climate. Any technologies that impede or reverse the expansion of the internet are likely to be considered negative or ignored. &quot;Planned obsolescence&quot; is not real contraction, it is a trick that promotes further expansion. Device manufacturers often push one model into extinction so they can expand the next model more quickly. Where excessive expansion threatens the earth, methods of environmental conservation arise. In ecological conservation the plentiful is passed over or diminished so that the rare can be protected and revered. But the internet has a strange influence on conservation: internet rituals gravitate towards increasing the already plentiful. Rather than diminish what is plentiful, what is plentiful on the internet is exalted, shared, multiplied, made viral. Rarity is quickly restored to the commonplace by retweet, remix, or reflection. Complex algorithms that conserve every bit and byte of a video stream are engineered to erupt that same stream through as many devices as possible. Everything online is geared towards growth. People proudly exclaim &quot;I&#39;m blowing up.&quot; What can be done to cool and calm the perceived negative effects of living in an explosion?</p>
<p>The explosion of the personality into multiple internet selves has opened up many people, including myself, to a lot of heartache. Self-dissipation becomes self-dissatisfaction. I spent years scattering myself into personality fragments on many different websites until I couldn&#39;t locate my whole self anywhere. These personality fragments became deeply embedded into distant servers. I felt that my persona had expanded out beyond my reach or control. The internet can contain that expanded personality, but that personality belongs to the internet and is not a part of your own body. You cannot possibly be ready to back up who you are on the internet with your own body because that internet self is not your body - its the internet&#39;s body. It takes work to accept that your personality is actually your own body. It takes language, all your senses, the repeated use of conceptual tools, teachers, rituals, failures, and some serious discipline to grow the self that is limited to your body. With any growth comes the possibility of dysfunction through dissipation. Our challenge today is to gather up those internet fragments and align them into a whole individual.</p>
<p>In my own life, I found that I was losing too much energy out onto the external internet to do effective internal work. So I took down my website and all my profiles and began contracting my internet use. At first I felt something akin to death. I felt dead to the world without my internet presence. I was in the underworld. It was like an encounter with evil, a meeting with extinction. But what a wonderful release it was! I felt like I was letting go of so much I had been holding onto, like a big sigh. It was a sigh of relief. It was my own way of reversing the flow, turning clockwise into counter-
clockwise.</p>
<p>When you are focused on contraction you stay quiet. You stay hidden. Reversing the flow means not relaying or reflecting information but absorbing and retaining it, turning outflow into inflow. When you do not comment you are contracting. When you do not link you are contracting. When you do not reply you are contracting. When you delete you are contracting. Patterns of unchecked expansion become reversed. When you search the internet you expand. When you create a profile you expand. When you share you expand. When you update you expand. When you contract you rest. Don&#39;t you want to rest? Turn inwards to rest and the internet can do that much less. It cools down a little.</p>
<p>Contraction can be dangerously self-limiting. If you take it too far you sink into the bog. But expansion can be dangerously grandiose. If you take expansion too far you crash and burn. This crash and burn syndrome is now relevant in debates about &quot;the right to be forgotten.&quot; Haunted by their most foolish years, people are beginning to fight for internet contraction. A push for contraction can also be seen in the rise of so- called &quot;slow movements&quot; across other disciplines. But contraction is more than just moving slowly - it means active decline. Every time you breathe out, pushing the diaphragm upwards to empty your lungs, you accept decline. I love to hold out. I love decline as much as I love growth. And I do not want to force the expansion of my life through external technologies. Unforced contraction means yielding to decline. If the word &quot;contraction&quot; is off-putting, consider it more like pruning blossoms at the end of a season so that the new flowers have a place to grow. Yes they are blossoms, but they have had their time and are finished.</p>
<p>Some scientists believe that even the domain of the woolly mammoth should expand again through the test tube. This is evidence that humanity has a hard time accepting decline. Forced contraction is seen as an undesirable &quot;evil&quot; while forced expansion is seen as &quot;progress.&quot; Fear of extinction as &quot;evil&quot; comes from over-reliance on the linear viewpoint. The concept of extinction belongs entirely to the &quot;timeline&quot; and not the &quot;time circle.&quot; Timeline interfaces of the social internet limit users to a linear perspective. Facebook&#39;s linear timeline has extended into the heart of a billion households, holding disproportionate authority over public and private activities. Restriction to a linear perspective makes for an unimaginative people who are fearful of data loss and dependent upon constant forward updates to make sense of the world. A cyclical timeline pulses without extinction.</p>
<p>The social rituals of the internet have succeeded in expanding our outer life, but what is contracting is our inner life. The result is a disconnection from a solid, unified self. Some people may not see a problem with self-expansion through the internet, but problems are easily buried under fast change. I believe that an expansion-</p>
<p>obsessed culture - over-reliant on technology - is in danger of either self-sterilising or blowing itself up. At its current pace, the internet will exhaust itself and collapse. In its place will be some kind of internet black hole. Enjoy the expansion while it’s around. Relish the ability to see so far, be thankful for expansion&#39;s conveniences. Contracting internet use now will help the internet to continue.</p>
<p>To close this text with a spirit of positive expansion, I will share some instructions from a crystallography website. Crystallisation, a magnificent form of cohesion, comes about through just the right balance of temperature:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.iycr2014.org/participate/crystal-growing-competition/info-for-newcomers/how-to-grow">http://www.iycr2014.org/participate/crystal-growing-competition/info-for-newcomers/how-to-grow</a></p>
<p><br>
<strong>How to Grow Crystals</strong></p>
<p>The idea is to grow a single crystal, not a bunch of crystals. You will first need to grow a small perfect crystal (your seed crystal) around which you will later grow a large crystal. It is therefore essential to avoid excessive rapid growth, which encourages the formation of multiple crystals instead of a single crystal.</p>
<p><strong>FAQ: Why did my crystal shrink or disappear?</strong></p>
<p>If your crystal shrank or disappeared, it was because the surrounding solution became undersaturated and the crystal material went back into solution. Undersaturation may occur when the temperature of a saturated solution increases, even by only a few degrees, depending upon the solute. (This is why temperature control is so important.)</p>

							<p>A blood rite/ mourning ritual/gift ceremony for tomorrow &#38; tomorrow. JD uses a pencil and a needle in a distributed ink drawing practice that takes place between bodies in a space of mutual exchange. The custodian of each drawing makes the first sketch in words as part of a conversation process where narratives are shared and compared, and where the groundwork is laid in language for making a meaningful ritual. Finally, the image is etched in ink on the body, where it will stay - on the cellular level at least - until the death of that body and beyond. The practice is a way of manifesting networked kinship in precarious times; it is also an attempt to contain the accumulated trauma of a life through externalising scar tissue as a badge of what we have already survived. Above all it is a &#39;despite-everything&#39; gesture of defiance to death (of physical bodies, community and communities), commoditisation, pointless posterity, monolithic art praxes that echo the totality of state sovereignty, and a way to embrace the inevitable, together.</p>

							<p>BioLudditism poses a challenge to the commonly accepted effects of bio-technologies, taking as its starting point the complex debate surrounding monocultures: GMOs, systems ecology, pandemic prevention, food deserts, sugar addiction, hormone replacement, public healthcare and the long arm of the biotech industry.</p>
<p>Following on from the NearNow panel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akfwKBdEAQc" target="_blank">‘Where are the Luddites: An Open Call for Bioluddites’</a> earlier this year, and the writing up of the Bioluddite Charter at the Breaking the Frame conference, Lisa Ma will use the next few months to continue her research into the contemporary resurgence of Ludditism.</p>
<p>Commencing with a series of interviews and sound recordings with participants other at this year’s <em>Extinction Marathon: Vision of the Future</em>, these will be released online over the course of the weekend.</p>
<p><a href="/images/participants/bioluddites_charter.pdf" target="_blank">Bioluddites Charter</a></p>
<h3 id="bioluddite">BioLuddite</h3>
<p>Could Luddites curate wiser technologies in The Biotech Revolution? In the 1800s a community of revolutionaries called Luddites protested against the social changes imposed upon the way people live by the introduction of factory machinery. Armed with a fake king and instruction manuals of machine destruction through songs, the legend of the Luddites became a derogatory term of anyone that opposes technological progress.  </p>
<p>In an age of makers and open source communities of The Digital Revolution, Bioluddites is a brave new step in socializing our relationship with biotechnology as well as the role of activism in the innovation process. The widespread phenomenon of DIY tinkering and open source communities has brought notions of citizenship closer to technology by making communities retrofit digital components on the market to their own needs. But in the new technology revolution, the needs of the everyday people should be considered before commercialization for the needs of corporations. </p>
<p>Bioluddites is a series of ongoing research and real-life experiments inspired by the Luddite community to create scenarios that make people think deeply and socially about how the next technological revolution will affect the way we live and make our living.</p>
<p>In collaboration with The Serpentine Gallery, I had the opportunity to ask some thought-leaders to help me ponder about what they think of the subject:</p>
<p><strong>James Bridle</strong> is a writer, artist and publisher literature, culture and technology. He questions and evaluates the application of technology and its methods of production and release. Bridle is the author of the <strong>New Aesthetic</strong> project that spurred much debate and gives lectures about the invisibility of technology.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“As soon as you introduce the word technology into a general conversation, people will have a fairly polarized result to it. That’s because you’re starting to talk about very complex, difficult things and complex difficult things have always been in the domain of experts. Most people are simply not confident enough to engage in those conversations because it is always framed as a domain for experts.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bridle argues that we can’t know how to evaluate risk in biotech without a social process. He believes that Luddites are essential to technology on the basis that Luddism was a social movement and technology is always formed by social processes. Bridle works to make the general public understand complexities, making a parallel between our general over simplification of technological systems with our inability to logically evaluate risk.</p>

<p><strong>Martin John Reas</strong>, the Astronomer Royal, writes books on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy" target="_blank">astronomy</a> and the problems relating to science, ethics and politics. Reas is the cofounder of The Centre for the Study of Existential Risk (CSER), a research centre at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Cambridge" target="_blank">University of Cambridge</a>, that studies “extinctional risk” posed by present or future technology.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It’s certainly true that people are rather irrational in the way that we calibrate risks. We fret too much about minor things, like carcinogens in food, low radiation doses, train crashes and things like that. We&#39;re in denial about some much bigger risks and I would include bio-error and bio-terror amongst those.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reas emphasizes that there is a risk in releasing biotechnologies out of labs that is even less controlled than in lab situations. We spoke about the pandemic of panic in cases of disasters such as the Ebola virus and when more attention should have been placed for longer-term investment in countries with little infrastructure.</p>

<p><strong>Carolyn Christov-Bakargiev</strong> was was the Artistic Director of Documenta 2013, an exhibition of modern and contemporary art that takes place for 100 days in Kessel, Germany, every five years. Named in 2012 as number one in the Power 100 list of the most influential figures in contemporary art, Christov-Bakargiev is the curator of of Istanbul Biennial. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Techne means craft… The question is not a question of today. The point is how they are used.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Christov Christov-Bakargiev</strong> ponders with us about the meaning of technology and gives examples of how technology is a natural course. She believes that technology itself is not a problem and that there is no distinction between the organic and inorganic. However, she emphasizes what she calls the misuse of and bad “ideas” in applying technology, such as using corn for fuel rather than food in biofuel, or in caring for the elderly with technology rather than humans. </p>

<p>If innovation is the end goal of new technologies, is all innovation really beneficial or simply reinforcing an over-optimism in newness? How might there be less wasteful and more constructive playgrounds for innovation in the kickstarter culture? Even the word ‘revolution’ is now a word reserved for large, anticipated technological breakthroughs rather than its original term for a shift in social order. In fact, revolts are viewed as negative obstacles against progress, exemplified by The Luddites. </p>
<p>Cultural Theorist Byung-Chul Han warns about today’s “terror of positivity”. In a society that discourages any opposition, even systems originally for the benefit of social uses will become quietly twisted for the control of customers. Negativity is associated with laziness, a lack of imagination and unproductivity.</p>
<p>However, Luddism generated opposition using a creative process. The Luddites understood the social conditions of activism in Nottingham and had expertise in creating mythical activist figures. The folklore of Robin Hood was used as early as the 13th Century to name outlaws. The name ‘Robin’ was a common stock name and ‘Hood’ meant anyone wearing a hat or a hood to hide their identities. The name that was itself the nature of safe resistance would later inspire modern movements such as Anonymous.</p>
<p>The Luddites went a step further, by making a fake king. They understood that social movements in a time of military power, people fought for popes and kings. The Luddites’ movement needed a central figure. Yet their experience taught them that leaders of revolutions were often killed, so they created a fake king. The character of Ned Ludd, often known as Captain Ludd, General Ludd or King Ludd that would be used to sign protest letters and head wars.</p>
<p><em>“Negativity slows down and prevents a chain reaction of sameness” - Byung-Chul Han.</em></p>
<p>The history of revolution of protest has shaped our society. Revolutions save human history from becoming a linear trajectory of what technology wants. In each era, Agricultural, Industrial, Digital, communities have revolted against the way that resources are distributed. There’s a world of innovation in the field of activism that we are wasting away:</p>
<p><em>Tattoo head: The Revolt of Ionia (in present-day Turkey) BC499</em><br>In order to send an undetected message to for the trapped General Histiaeus, his favorite servant tattooed the word “revolt” on his shaven head and waited for it to grow back before travelling to deliver the disguised message.</p>

<p><em>Bite the Bullet: The Indian Rebellion, 1857</em><br>Debate about the inequality of treatment to Indian soldiers was started by rumours that the paper cartridges, which had to bitten to open before being ignited, were greased with cow fat. </p>

<p><em>Invention of the Zoo: During The French Revolution, 1793</em><br>The National Assembly decreed that all aristocrats’ exotic animals were to be either killed and stuffed for scientific purposes or donated to the Jardin des Plantes. The latter became the zoo. </p>
<p>img</p>

<p><em>Fem Warrior: Vietnam, BC248</em><br>Lady Triệu initiated a culture of resistance against the Chinese Empire and confronted every aspect of the eastern Confucian &#39;womanhood&#39;, winning battle her gender confused the Chinese soldiers. Over time Lady Triệu gained superhuman status in a mythical feminism: “breasts three feet long, which she reportedly threw over her shoulders as she rode her elephant into battle”.</p>

<h3 id="bios-voices-of-labourers">Bios Voices of Labourers</h3>
<p>&#39;The Biotech Revolution&#39; is hailed as the new technological era but has in fact been an integral part of our everyday lives for a long while, controlled by large industries. It is already a fundamental aspect of everyday life and the political system in which we operate in, yet is still presented as a far, distant future.</p>
<p>In an age of tinkering and open source communities of The Digital Revolution, decentralized citizen lab-based for synbio has mushroomed as centers to familiarize people on <em>what</em> biotechnology actually is, but are we asking enough questions about the <em>how</em> it will be used?</p>
<p>As <strong>Carolyn Christov-Bakargiev</strong> pointed out again:</p>
<p>Bios = the manner of living (<em>the how</em>)<br>Zio = alive, living (<em>the what</em>)</p>
<p>(audio Carolyn_01 0:34-3:30 &amp; Carolyn_02)</p>
<p>Rather than asking about for or against biotechnology per say, we as citizens, should take a closer and more active stance in the how biotechnology will be used, integrated and eventually, socialized. With such an “compromised term” of Bioluddite, Biotechnology and Bio-era, we should be taking a closer step in its political system of integration rather than passively allow decisions to be made for commercialization alone. </p>
<h3 id="how-will-biotechnology-change-our-work-conditions-our-healthcare-plans-our-pension-schemes-our-livelihood-">How will biotechnology change our work conditions, our healthcare plans, our pension schemes, our livelihood?</h3>
<p>BioLuddite transfers the traditional voice of a social critique towards this new technology revolution, to ensure thatprogress is anchored towards what people want, rather than what technology wants. This would be a technological revolution. Let’s socialize before we commercialise.</p>

							Lisa Ma believes in socialising activism rather than idolising perfect futures. Creating 'Farmification' with workers of joystick factories in Shenzhen, Spa experiences at cat ladies’ homes in London and political movements with vegetarians to eat – instead of poison – invasive animals in Belgium, Lisa Ma wants to make activism iterative, innovative and reflective, like a design process. Currently she is starting a movement with the historical community of Luddites to guide our social relationship with biotechnology. Lisa Ma digs out the everyday clashes of values between what we do and what we believe in.

							<p>The Ongoing Collapse is a growing collection of data sources and links positioned as a reflection of the state of the world in the terms that it likes to use. It&#39;s a gentle ticking of the crumbling weird at the base of civilisation, quoting e.g. the present value of crude oil, the number of parts per million of carbon in the atmosphere or the number of man-made objects in space. The Ongoing Collapse forms a central platform of The Serpentine&#39;s <strong><em>EXTINCT.LY</em></strong>.</p>

							<p>The exhibition <em>Extinct in the Wild</em> brings together flora and fauna that are no longer found in nature, but persist exclusively in cultivation or captivity. Officially designated “extinct in the wild,” these homeless species have left nature behind to fully enter the circuits of human culture.</p>
<p>Each species is displayed within a life-support system tailored to the organism’s unique needs. Exhibition staff will be trained to tend these fragile living organisms. Returning curation to its ancient roots in <em>cura</em>, meaning “care,” the curator becomes a caretaker.</p>
<p>The exhibition transports species across national borders, and transplants nature into the space of high culture. In an age of mass extinction, these modernist techniques of displacement and collage have become strategies of survival.</p>
<p><em>Extinct in the Wild</em> is currently under development as a winner of the Fondazione Prada and Qatar Museum Authority’s Curate Award.</p>
<p>On the <a href="http://extinct.ly/map" target="_blank">interactive map</a>, the symbol &quot;EW&quot; marks the last location a species was observed in the wild.</p>

        <p>This work of net.art is a corporate and institutional cross-projection and a brutal manifestation of Newspeak. The destruction of common meaning in language drives extinction and creates collateral damage when Data Mining industries talk and act on ‘Real-Time Anti-Fraud’ and ‘Counter-Terrorism Financing’. Real meaning disappears behind profit-seeking and every transaction is under suspicion. The never-ending tracking of people’s actions is (mis)labeled as customer service.</p>

        <p>The video shows a tracking shot of aerial images of BP’s &#39;Deepwater Horizon’ oil-spill in the Gulf of Mexico, beautifully wrapped around a sphere. The source images are from the massive oil-painting on an 80.000 square-mile canvas with over 800 million liters of oil. This piece cements the position of oil-painting as the supreme discipline of art, but at the same time gives evidence of the delicate and endangered position of painting if the discipline refuses to radically embrace technology.</p>

							<p>A blood rite/ mourning ritual/gift ceremony for tomorrow &#38; tomorrow. JD uses a pencil and a needle in a distributed ink drawing practice that takes place between bodies in a space of mutual exchange. The custodian of each drawing makes the first sketch in words as part of a conversation process where narratives are shared and compared, and where the groundwork is laid in language for making a meaningful ritual. Finally, the image is etched in ink on the body, where it will stay - on the cellular level at least - until the death of that body and beyond. The practice is a way of manifesting networked kinship in precarious times; it is also an attempt to contain the accumulated trauma of a life through externalising scar tissue as a badge of what we have already survived. Above all it is a &#39;despite-everything&#39; gesture of defiance to death (of physical bodies, community and communities), commoditisation, pointless posterity, monolithic art praxes that echo the totality of state sovereignty, and a way to embrace the inevitable, together.</p>

							Jesse Darling is an artist living in London. Their work addresses the human condition and how it is mediated through the structures, narratives and technologies that govern life as we know it, considering the social and physical body as a site where they manifest and become transformed. JD works in sculpture, installation, text and ‘dasein by design’ – where performance and unmediated experience meet. Exhibitions include Private Settings: Art After the Internet (Museum of Modern Art, Warsaw), Preteen Gallery’s It’s been four years since 2010 and Not Long Now at LIMAZULU, London, 2014. JD is represented by Arcadia_Missa.
