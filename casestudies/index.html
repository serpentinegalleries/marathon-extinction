						<p>
							Appropedia is a green living wiki for collaborative solutions in sustainability, appropriate technology and poverty reduction. It is an open site for all matters of international development and aid, encouraging the sharing of information and collaboration with others in order to lighten our ecological footprint and live rich, sustainable lives.
						</p>
						<p>
							<iframe width="560" height="315" src="" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>Guided by the use of sound principles, appropriate technology and the sharing of wisdom and project information, Appropedia allows anyone to add, remove, or edit content on topics such as construction, energy, food/agriculture, health, medical devices, solar and transport.</p>
<p>Often described as an &quot;appropriate technology wiki,&quot; Appropedia is much broader than that - stakeholders can come together to find, create and improve scalable and adaptable solutions. This can include sharing information and collaborating with others on how we can live in harmony with nature and our environment in developed countries, or discuss, e.g., low cost technologies for use in the developing world. In its earliest stages, Appropedia was a collaboration between passionate people from the United States and Australia, before quickly expanding to become a global project.</p>

					<h2>Detroit Water Brigade</h2>
				</div>
				<div class="modal-body">
						<p>
							Detroit Water Brigade is a volunteer-led alliance of compassionate citizens of Detroit and their international allies working to bring emergency relief to families facing water shut offs while advocating for an income-based Water Affordability Plan in Detroit.
						</p>
						<p>
							<iframe width="560" height="315" src="" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>The Detroit Water and Sewage Department is conducting mass water shut offs in Detroit Michigan which will affect over 120,000 account holders over a 3 month period at a rate of 3,000 per week. This accounts for over 40% of customers who are using the Detroit Water system and has been dubbed a violation of Human Rights by various organizations. 70,000 of those accounts are residential accounts which could amount to anywhere from 200,000-300,000 people directly affected. Without water, the threat to the health and safety of Detroit residents becomes immediate, the resulting negative effects of mass water shut offs begin just 2 days after shut off and can become endemic in just 60 days time.</p>
<p>When taking the scope into account (120,000 water accounts or 300,000+ people) the implications become clear; this is a disaster zone and immediate relief and preparation is needed.The eight ways in which DWB is making an impact are through: drinkable water provisions; rainwater collection; cold weather gear; publishing and writing helpful information packs; advocacy and awareness; network distribution hubs; resource delivery; online DWB network.</p>

							AMEG is a group of determined scientists, engineers, communicators and others, dedicated firstly to establishing what is really happening to our planet (especially in the Arctic) using the best scientific evidence, and secondly to finding effective and affordable means to deal with the situation, thirdly to communicating these matters.

						<p>
							<iframe width="560" height="315" src="" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>AMEG&#39;s declaration states:</p>
<p>&quot;Governments must get a grip on a situation which IPCC, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, has ignored. A strategy of mitigation and adaptation is doomed to fail. It will be impossible to adapt to the worst consequences of global warming, as IPCC suggests. The Arctic must be cooled, ASAP, to prevent the sea ice disappearing with disastrous global consequences. Rapid warming in the Arctic, as sea ice retreats, has already disrupted the jet stream. The resulting escalation in weather extremes is causing a food crisis which must be addressed before the existing conflicts in Asia and Africa spread more widely. Dangerous global warming and ocean acidification must be prevented by reducing the level of CO2 in the atmosphere, especially by improved agricultural practice, thereby addressing the food crisis at the same time. This is an unprecedented opportunity for international collaboration for common purpose. There is no excuse for procrastination. We must see action now.&quot;</p>

							Ethereum is a platform and a programming language that makes it possible for any developer to build and publish next-generation distributed applications.
						</p>
						<p>
							<iframe width="560" height="315" src="" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>Ether, Ethereum&#39;s cryptofuel, powers the applications on a decentralized network. Ethereum can be used to codify, decentralize, secure and trade just about anything, from intellectual property to smart property.</p>
<p>Ethereum makes use of one of the lesser known innovations by Satashi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous person or group of people who designed and created the original Bitcoin software. When Nakamoto set the Bitcoin blockchain into motion in 2009, two radical and untested concepts were introduced. Bitcoin as a currency unit has taken up the bulk of public attention. However, there is also another, equally important, part to Satoshi&#39;s grand experiment: the concept of a proof of work-based blockchain to allow for public agreement on the order of transactions. Attention is starting to shift toward this second part of Bitcoin&#39;s technology, and how the blockchain concept can be used for more than just money.</p>
<p>What Ethereum intends to provide is a blockchain with a built-in fully fledged Turing-complete programming language that can be used to create &quot;contracts&quot; for encoding arbitrary state transition functions. Simply by writing up the logic in a few lines of code, users will be allowed to create systems such as domain names, decentralized exchange, financial derivatives and on-blockchain identity and reputation systems. Another important area of inquiry is &quot;smart contracts&quot; - systems which automatically move digital assets according to pre-specified rules. The logical extension of this is decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) - long-term smart contracts that contain the assets and the bylaws of an entire organization.</p>

					<h2>BITNATION</h2>
				</div>
				<div class="modal-body">
						<p>
							BITNATION provides a full range of services traditionally offered by governments. Among these are: a cryptographically secure ID system, blockchain based dispute resolution, marriage and divorce, land registry, education, insurance, security, diplomacy and more, through a fully distributed platform.
						</p>
						<p>
							<iframe width="560" height="315" src="" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>The extra-governmental approach of BITNATION is motivated by the idea that &quot;Only a free and dynamic market of governance services can produce the highest quality at the lowest cost, as well as constant innovation for its customers&quot; (Susanna Tarkowski Tempelhof, Founder and CEO, BITNATION).</p>
<p>BITNATION is BORDERLESS: it does not care where in the world you are from, where you live, or what passport you hold. Everyone has the right to enjoy high-end, competitive governance services. BITNATION is DECENTRALIZED: it operates on the Blockchain - a cryptographically secured public ledger distributed amongst all of its millions of users around the world, to ensure peer-to-peer autonomy. BITNATION is VOLUNTARY: dedicated to the open source philosophy, and provides a platform for users to develop their own governance functions, or fork the code and create a brand new governance system.Contracts made through BITNATION are not currently recognized by governments: Recognition will grow organically over time, in tandem with mainstream adoption. When Bitcoin was first invented it wasn&#39;t recognised as a currency, until a significant amount of people started using it as a currency - the same is likely to apply in the case of BITNATION - although the recognition may be quicker since there are already a significant percentage of contracts and disputes being arbitrated by private courts around the world.</p>

					<h2>Language Extinction Risk</h2>
				</div>
				<div class="modal-body">
						<p>
							Many of the world's languages face serious risk of extinction. Efforts to prevent this cultural loss are severely constrained by a poor understanding of the geographical patterns and drivers of extinction risk.
						</p>
						<p>
							<p>The authors of the paper &quot;Global distribution and drivers of language extinction risk&quot; quantifies the global distribution of language extinction risk and identifies the underlying environmental and socioeconomic drivers.</p>
<p>The research presented shows that both small range and speaker population sizes are associated with rapid declines in speaker numbers, causing 25% of existing languages to be threatened based on criteria used for species. Language range and population sizes are small in tropical and arctic regions, particularly in areas with high rainfall, high topographic heterogeneity and/or rapidly growing human populations. By contrast, recent speaker declines have mainly occurred at high latitudes and are strongly linked to high economic growth. Threatened languages are numerous in the tropics, the Himalayas and northwestern North America. These results indicate that small-population languages remaining in economically developed regions are seriously threatened by continued speaker declines. However, risks of future language losses are especially high in the tropics and in the Himalayas, as these regions harbour many small-population languages and are undergoing rapid economic growth.</p>

<p>&#35;hack4good is an international hackathon, where creatives, designers and developers build solutions for humanity&#39;s biggest challenges. In 48 hours, teams brainstorm, design and develop solutions tailored to the needs of knowledge experts (NGOs, governments) who lack technical expertise. These knowledge experts bring in challenges from the field and depend on the theme of the hackathon.</p>
<p>In the previous hackathon the theme was Climate Change and over 1000 participants built over 100 apps to help solve issues related to Climate Change. The theme is different every hackathon and always serves social good.</p>

						<p>
							The Hexayurt is a simplified disaster relief shelter design. It is based on a geodesic geometry adapted to construction from standard 4x8 foot sheets of factory-made construction material. It resembles a panel yurt, hence the name. The hexayurt is integral to the Networked Domestic Disaster Response project, which focuses on public coordination of disaster relief efforts.
						</p>

<p>This offloads the responsibility largely from the state or government, which unites several cheap and readily available technologies to perform tasks that have been historically left to highly trained teams with expensive apparatus.</p>
<p>The plan outlines a system of cellphone-accessible databases which would collocate raw materials, displaced people, host families and volunteer building teams to rapidly provide temporary accommodations for people made homeless by a natural disaster or man-made circumstances. The plan has been positively reviewed by the American Red Cross and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The Hexayurt building&#39;s design is in the Buckminster Fuller lineage of using contiguous triangles to maximize the load-bearing ability of simple structures. For constructions made from light material the panels can be joined by tape. For heavier builds made out of OSB or plywood, metal brackets or wooden blocks can be used. The instructions are available on <a href="http://appropedia.org">Appropedia</a> (Appropedia is used as the wiki for the hexayurt project) and are released as public domain by the inventor Vinay Gupta.</p>

<p>Free, collaborative maps are uniquely valuable to humanitarian work, especially in places where base map data is often scarce, out of date, or rapidly changing. OpenStreetMap is a project to create a free and open map of the entire world, built entirely by volunteers surveying with GPS and liberating existing public sources of geographic data.</p>
<p>The majority of the activities of HOT occur remotely. When an event occurs the first thing that happens is a search for existing data and available satellite imagery. During this time also responding organizations are contacted to determine their needs. Someone from HOT is assigned during each response to coordinate the effort. This person makes sure everyone knows when new resources are available as well as where to focus efforts. Sometimes after this type of response work in country begins. An example of post disaster work is in Haiti, after the January 2010 earthquake there was much remote activity to gather OpenStreetMap data.</p>

<p>Water is one of the world&#39;s most stressed resources. Usage has shot up by more than double the rate of population increase, meaning we are guzzling more water per head than ever before.</p>
<p>Off the back of some of our preliminary research, one key component of what we are planning to do with Open Droplet is to provide context to the data collected by individual sensors. This will involve a two-way flow of data between individuals, and utilities and public bodies who are responsible for the water infrastructure. This turns Open Droplet into more than just a water sensor - it&#39;s a means of understanding how individual water flows fit within the overall water infrastructure.</p>

<p>Lantern is a small, solar-charged device that continuously receives radio waves broadcast by Outernet from space (Outernet is like the radio station and Lantern is like the radio). Lantern turns the Outernet signal into digital files, such as webpages, news articles, ebooks, videos, and music. The majority of accessible content is user driven - determined by a process of suggestions and requests - while the rest is comprised of a ‘Core Archive’ of educational material and disaster updates. Additional sponsored content is always presented as such.</p>
<p>Lantern can receive and store any type of digital file on its internal drive. To view the content stored in Lantern, users simply turn on the Wi-Fi hotspot and connect to Lantern with any Wi-Fi enabled device. All that’s needed is a browser - Outernet is free to use and all data consumption via Outernet is anonymous.</p>
<p>Outernet’s long term goal is to assist the formation of communities of web users with access to a neutral resource that can educate and empower. Its primary audience is those who live in places where internet connections are liable to go down (anywhere in the world when a disaster occurs) or in places lacking the infrastructure required for a higher online population. It is the best known alternative to plans by Facebook to increase one-to-many broadcast style connectivity in Africa by means of drones, or balloons in the case of Google’s ‘Project Loon’.</p>

<p>The culmination of twelve years of research, RoboBee solved two key technical challenges of micro-robotics. Engineers invented a process inspired by pop-up books that allowed them to build on a sub-millimeter scale precisely and efficiently. To achieve flight, they created artificial muscles capable of beating the wings 120 times per second.</p>
<p>The goal of the RoboBee project is to make a fully autonomous swarm of flying robots for applications such as search and rescue and artificial pollination. To make this feasible, researchers need to figure out how to get power supply and decision making functions, which are currently handled via a tiny tether to the robot, on board.The 3-centimeter (1.2 in) wingspan of RoboBee makes it the smallest man-made device modeled on an insect to achieve flight. Inspired by the biology of a bee and the insect&#39;s hive behavior, Robobees researchers aim to push advances in miniature robotics and the design of compact high-energy power sources; spur innovations in ultra-low-power computing and electronic &quot;smart&quot; sensors; and refine coordination algorithms to manage multiple, independent machines.</p>
