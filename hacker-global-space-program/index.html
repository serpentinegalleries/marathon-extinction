<p>Hackerspace Global Space Program proposes an organization enabling collaboration amongst scalable grassroots community units. Aims include expanding humanity&#39;s reach and presence beyond Earth&#39;s orbit, as well as improving our chances here on Earth by spurring the innovation needed to solve global challenges, resource constraints and the need to get along in an increasingly crowded environment.The technical approach is to support and fund Hackerspaces to function as local community hubs, carry out research and public engagement activities, conduct long term strategic foresight and planning to coordinate large scale international projects with the local hubs and lastly, to identify and expand areas of mutual relevance between terrestrial and space activities.</p>
<p>Hackerspace activities include leadership and technical workshops for youth, while the mission of Hackerspace Global Space Program includes finding appropriate external partners, and applying principles from strategic foresight and planning for the central leadership to coordinate large scale international projects with local hubs and project partners. Hackerspaces currently doing space related projects include Noisebridge, San Francisco, which welcomes everyone to use their resources, including an electronics lab, machine shop, sewing/crafting supplies, two classrooms, a conference area, library, darkroom, and kitchen.</p>
