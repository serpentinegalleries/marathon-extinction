<p>The Detroit Water and Sewage Department is conducting mass water shut offs in Detroit Michigan which will affect over 120,000 account holders over a 3 month period at a rate of 3,000 per week. This accounts for over 40% of customers who are using the Detroit Water system and has been dubbed a violation of Human Rights by various organizations. 70,000 of those accounts are residential accounts which could amount to anywhere from 200,000-300,000 people directly affected. Without water, the threat to the health and safety of Detroit residents becomes immediate, the resulting negative effects of mass water shut offs begin just 2 days after shut off and can become endemic in just 60 days time.</p>
<p>When taking the scope into account (120,000 water accounts or 300,000+ people) the implications become clear; this is a disaster zone and immediate relief and preparation is needed.The eight ways in which DWB is making an impact are through: drinkable water provisions; rainwater collection; cold weather gear; publishing and writing helpful information packs; advocacy and awareness; network distribution hubs; resource delivery; online DWB network.</p>
