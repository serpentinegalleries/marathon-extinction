<p>A blood rite/ mourning ritual/gift ceremony for tomorrow &#38; tomorrow. JD uses a pencil and a needle in a distributed ink drawing practice that takes place between bodies in a space of mutual exchange. The custodian of each drawing makes the first sketch in words as part of a conversation process where narratives are shared and compared, and where the groundwork is laid in language for making a meaningful ritual. Finally, the image is etched in ink on the body, where it will stay - on the cellular level at least - until the death of that body and beyond. The practice is a way of manifesting networked kinship in precarious times; it is also an attempt to contain the accumulated trauma of a life through externalising scar tissue as a badge of what we have already survived. Above all it is a &#39;despite-everything&#39; gesture of defiance to death (of physical bodies, community and communities), commoditisation, pointless posterity, monolithic art praxes that echo the totality of state sovereignty, and a way to embrace the inevitable, together.</p>
