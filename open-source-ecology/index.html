<p>Focused on developing open source industrial machines that can be made for a fraction of commercial costs, with all designs shared freely online. The goal of Open Source Ecology is to create an open source economy - an efficient economy which increases innovation through open collaboration.</p>
<p>The current practical implementation of the GVCS is a life size LEGO set of powerful, self-replicating production tools for distributed production. The Set includes fabrication and automated machines that make other machines. Through the GVCS, OSE intends to build not individual machines - but machine construction systems, so that new machines can be built from existing machines, the GVCS is intended to be a kernel for building infrastructures of modern civilization.</p>
